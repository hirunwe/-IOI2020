# -IOI2020

Everything i do to get ready for **International Olympiad Of Informatics 2020** is here.
I update this repo on the go and will update README.md for special Commits.

This Includes:

- USACO Training
- Codeforces Contests
- National Olympiad Contests (Sri Lanka)
- Other Exercises

The [USACO](https://train.usaco.org/) on-line training pages provide hundreds of hours of free instruction and practice problems to improve your programming and problem-solving skills. It's awesome. You should check it out if you haven't already.


[Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/) is a  site where they hosts contests very frequently. That's also very cool and many Olympiad Contestants participate in 'em.

**I hope this repository helps you at least a little in your journey:)**

Even If you are not  participating in any Olympiad or Contest, Competitive Programming is AWESOME. So try it out.
